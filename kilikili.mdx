title: How to Use Waves Text-to-Speech
description: Convert written prompts into natural audio in a single call.

Waves Text-to-Speech (TTS) turns any UTF-8 text into lifelike audio in seconds. Use it to narrate UI text, generate product voice-overs, or prototype multimodal assistants without managing audio pipelines yourself.

## Endpoint

| Method | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `POST` | `https://api.waves.smallest.ai/v4/tts` |

## Required Headers

- `Authorization: Bearer <WAVES_API_KEY>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Request Body

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | string | ✅ | Text to render (≤ 5000 chars). |
| `voice` | string | ✅ | Voice preset ID, e.g. `en-US-luna`. |
| `speed` | number | optional | Playback rate (0.5–2.0, default `1`). |
| `format` | string | optional | Audio container; `mp3`, `wav`, `ogg` (default `mp3`). |

## Sample Request (curl)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.waves.smallest.ai/v4/tts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WAVES_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Welcome to Waves! Let us speak for your product.",
    "voice": "en-US-luna",
    "speed": 1.05,
    "format": "mp3"
  }'
```

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "request_id": "req_91ff7b62f4bc4c08",
  "duration_ms": 2380,
  "audio": {
    "format": "mp3",
    "bytes": "base64-encoded-audio",
    "url": "https://cdn.waves.smallest.ai/audio/req_91ff7b62f4bc4c08.mp3",
    "expires_at": "2025-11-18T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "voice": "en-US-luna"
}
```

## Usage Tip

Cache the `audio.url` (or decoded bytes) in your app—each identical `text + voice + speed` combo costs another request if you re-render it.
